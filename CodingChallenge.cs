//Simple coding exercise:
 
//In the programming language of your choice, write a program that parses a sentence and replaces each word with the following: first letter, number of distinct characters between first and last character, and last letter.
//Words are separated by spaces or non-alphabetic characters and these separators should be maintained in their original form and location in the answer. 

//For example:

//Input 1:                It was many and many a year ago
//Output 1:            I0t w1s m2y a1d m2y a y2r a1o

//Input 2:                Copyright, Microsoft:Corporation
//Output 2:            C7t, M6t:C7n

//User interface expectations :
//Input: Command Line Interface: One should be able to pass the argument (input) on command line
//Output: Should print the output on command line


//Please follow the rules below:
 
//•	Code variables must be in English.
//•	Use the main function arguments.
//•	The function should not be static nor main.
//•	The function should not use hardcoded values.
//•	The function must be reusable.
//•	Document your code.
//•	Provide the file(s) in .zip format.



//A few of the things we will be looking at is accuracy, efficiency, solution completeness. 

//Please include this problem description in the comment at the top of your solution. 
//The problem is designed to take approximately 1-2 hours and will be used as a conversation point in the verbal assessment part of the on-site interview.  Please complete the coding assessment and have your solution uploaded as soon as possible.Please upload your solution to Dropbox or similar option (not G-Drive) and send a link to download the folder prior to your interview. [NOTE: Do include the results of your test run with your test data, along with the source-code while mailing us your solution]
