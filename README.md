=================================================================================
Simple coding exercise:
 
In the programming language of your choice, write a program that parses a sentence and replaces each word with the following: first letter, number of distinct characters between first and last character, and last letter. 
Words are separated by spaces or non-alphabetic characters and these separators should be maintained in their original form and location in the answer. 

For example:

Input 1:                It was many and many a year ago
Output 1:            I0t w1s m2y a1d m2y a y2r a1o

Input 2:                Copyright,Microsoft:Corporation
Output 2:            C7t,M6t:C7n
 
User interface expectations :
Input: Command Line Interface: One should be able to pass the argument (input) on command line
Output: Should print the output on command line
 
Please follow the rules below:
 
•	Code variables must be in English.
•	Use the main function arguments.
•	The function should not be static nor main.
•	The function should not use hardcoded values.
•	The function must be reusable.
•	Document your code.
•	Provide the file(s) in .zip format.
 
 
A few of the things we will be looking at is accuracy, efficiency, solution completeness. 

Please include this problem description in the comment at the top of your solution. 
The problem is designed to take approximately 1-2 hours and will be used as a conversation point in the verbal assessment part of the on-site interview.  Please complete the coding assessment and have your solution uploaded as soon as possible. Please upload your solution to Dropbox or similar option (not G-Drive) and send a link to download the folder prior to your interview. [NOTE: Do include the results of your test run with your test data, along with the source-code while mailing us your solution]
